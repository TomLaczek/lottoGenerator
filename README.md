This is simple example of lottoGenerator.
I used mostly HTML,CSS and Bootstrap for design represenatation.
For navigation I have used horizontal aligment.
In DuzyLotek section you can find button which runs JS script and randomly choose 6 numbers of range 1 and 49.
JS function is hidden but you can check it out by inspect page or on my github.
Contact form is blank and there is nothing so far.
Cheers,
Tomas
